TODO Tracker
============
TODO tracks is a tool to let users get a handle on the various TODOs they or
their teammate have added over time. This allows people to track progress by
examining the TODOs remaining.

The tool will examine all the branches, local and remote and process the TODOs
in the different revisions and present them to the user. 

Use cases:
- List the TODOs in a branch.
- Examine when a TODO was added, removed, and who added it.
- (coming soon) Show which branches a TODO is in.
- (coming soon) Show a diff of the TODOs between two branches.

<!--
TODO: Add a getting started section.
-->
<!--
TODO: Add a section detailing a sample workflow.
-->
