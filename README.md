TODO Tracker
============
<!--
TODO: Add more use cases we want to support.
-->
TODO tracks is a tool to let users get a handle on the various TODOs they or
their teammate have added over time. This allows people to track progress by
examining the TODOs remaining.

The tool will examine all the branches, local and remote and process the TODOs
in the different revisions and present them to the user. 

Use cases:
- Examine when a TODO was added, removed, who added.
- Hierarchy of TODOs, that is a higher level TODO was replaced with smaller
  scoped TODOs.

TODO: this is a test, remove soon.
